# Android eXiSoundVis Plugin

This plugin is an implementation of the [eXiSoundVis plugin for UE4](https://github.com/eXifreXi/eXiSoundVis) which has been altered to allow for use on Android devices.

### Notes:
- In order to use this plugin within your project, please make sure to add the 'android.permissions.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE' permission in the Android settings section of your Project Settings.
- There is a known incompatibility in the case of the Google Project Tango Yellowstone Tablet being used with Unreal Engine 4, which means it is not possible to play .obb files with a 44khz sample rate correctly. This is true of both files loaded at runtime and those imported as assets at build/compile time in UE4. Please be sure to replace any 44khz files with .obbs with a 22khz sample rate, otherwise the .obb files will be played back at an incorrect, slower speed.

- The plugin currently only supports loading from absolute paths on Android at present.
